## Recylclable and Low-Fat Products [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/)

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

**Schema:**

```text
Products:
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
```

**Example:**

```text
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |

## Average Time of Process per Machine [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-time-of-process-per-machine/)

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the `'end' timestamp` minus the `'start' timestamp`. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

**Schema:**

```text
Activity:
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
```

**Example:**

```text
Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |

| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
Output:
+------------+-----------------+
| machine_id | processing_time |
+------------+-----------------+
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |
+------------+-----------------+
```

```mySQL
SELECT a.machine_id, ROUND(SUM(a.timestamp - b.start) / COUNT(a.process_id),3) as processing_time
FROM Activity a
LEFT JOIN (
SELECT machine_id, process_id, timestamp as start
FROM Activity b
WHERE activity_type = "start"
) b
ON a.machine_id = b.machine_id and a.process_id = b.process_id
WHERE activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY a.machine_id

**Solution:**

```mySQL
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, a.subject_name, IFNULL(b.times_taken,0) as attended_exams
FROM students s
JOIN (
SELECT subject_name
FROM subjects ) a
LEFT JOIN (
SELECT student_id, subject_name, COUNT(subject_name) as times_taken
FROM examinations
GROUP BY student_id, subject_name) b
ON b.student_id = s.student_id AND a.subject_name = b.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, a.subject_name
```
