# Leetcode Problem - Roman to Integer
# https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/
#
# GOAL: Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L,
#   C, D and M. For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two
#   one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II.
#   The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
#   Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
#   However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is
#   written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making
#   four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as
#   IX. Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed
#   to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
#
# OVERVIEW: Blah blah

# Variety of test cases.
test1 = "X"
test2 = "IX"
test3 = "III"

# This function takes a string of a roman numeral and returns a valid integer.
def romanToInt(s: str) -> int:

    return

print("Input: ", s, "Output: ", romanToInt(s))
